## **Yelp Graphic**

### **Background**
In this class assignment, we were asked to make a graphic from the Yelp dataset. Because this dataset is huge, I chose to explore the most popular Yelp cuisine in each state by choosing select cuisines (those that seem the most appetizing to me) to analyze.

### **Content**
This short project culminates in a map of the lower 48 United States, colored by the most popular Yelp cuisine. The cuisine displayed is the one with the highest proportion in its state, versus that with the highest count, in order to normalize the uneven count distribution among cuisines. I have included the original Yelp dataset (business.Rdata), another dataframe I found (state_abbreviations.csv), as well as my resulting graphic in .png format.
